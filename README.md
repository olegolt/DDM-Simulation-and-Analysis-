# DDM-Simulation-and-Analysis-
Here I simulated some data based on DDM parameters obtained by Germar & Mojzisch (2019) and created a analysis pipeline

For experimental setup and hypotheses please look here: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103118304347?via%3Dihub

If you would like to simulate and analyse the data by yourself follow the following steps:

1. Open the Rproject file: "SimulateDataDDM"

2. Open the script "simulate_reading_data" and run it. It will simulate data based on the parameters defined in this script.

3. Open the script "DDM_analyses" and run it. It will analyse the simulated data and save the DDM parameters for every participant.

4. Open the script "analyses" and run it. It will analyse the proportion of orange responses and the drift rate parameters for both norms and stimulus conditions and plot the results.

That's it :)
